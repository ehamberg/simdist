Kill child process (master and/or child) if the distribution system
fails.  Perhaps by installing clean-up hook in Feedback::Error?
Consider operator() and operator binding.


OSX/Darwin:
Fix configure.in to check for/include/have option to include /opt/local/include and /opt/local/lib.  

At the moment, configure.in must be run with CPPFLAGS='-I/opt/local/include' LDFLAGS='-L/opt/local/lib'.

The mpiexec of LAM/MPI does not correctly pass on quoted
arguments; the quotes are stripped off.  This means that if you
send --arg='a short sentence' to simdist-mpi via LAM's mpirun,
simdist-mpi will in fact receive 3 arguments: '--arg=a', 'short',
and 'sentence'.  The problem is fixed in OpenMPI, which
supercedes LAM/MPI.
